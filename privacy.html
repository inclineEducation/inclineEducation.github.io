		(hereinafter, "us", "we", or "inclineedu.org"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what 
		information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply 
		to our collection of information from other sources.</p>
		<p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="">This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our

					<br><h3 class="mb-4 section-title" data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="">Website Visitors</h3>
		<p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="">Like most website operators, Incline Education collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, 
		referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Incline Education's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Incline Education's visitors use its website. From time to time, Incline 
		Education may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
		<!--
		<p>Incline Education also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on http://inclineedu.org blog posts. Incline Education only discloses logged 
		in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
		-->
					<br><h3 class="mb-4 section-title" data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
		<p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="">Certain visitors to Incline Education's websites choose to interact with Incline Education in ways that require Incline Education to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of 
		information that Incline Education gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who utilize our <a href="contact.html">contact form</a> to provide an email for response purposes.</p>

					<br><h3 class="mb-4 section-title" data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="">Security</h3>
		<p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="">The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use 
		commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
